#use occupancy grid as input
#-> deal with uncertainties from the occupancy grid

#avoid collision:
#-> buffer zone near obstacles where nodes are "pseudo occupied"
#-> modify the cost function such that nodes near obstacles are “more expensive” (may not be able to avoid collisions or need an extra function for this)
